## Bell Choir, Lab 2
This is the second lab of the operating systems course. This lab implements the idea of multithreading once again, but this times by the means of a bell choir. The rules of  my bell choir are simple: there is one conductor that tells the choir members when it is their turn and how long to play, the choir members can only play one note at a time, and then after they are playing they must give up their turn so another member can play a note.

Nate Williams provided us with the Tone.java file which had many methods that are used throughout my program.  This lab does require input from the user. If the user does not have a directory at the program level, one will be created upon execution. 

I once again had EXCEPTIONAL help from my good friends, Jake Gross√© and Jaden Bathon. They guided me through this lab while sharing ideas and helping me understand new, efficient ways to create a program like this one.
